## Overview 

This is the code for [this](https://youtu.be/cw6_OP5An8s) video on Youtube by Siraj Raval on DeepMind AlphaFold. This is a re-implemention of 
[Sheng and Jinbo's deep leanring model](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005324) on protein contacts prediction, 
which is a breakthrough in protein structure prediction. 
However, unfortunately they did not opensource their codes and models. So its a re-implementation of their methods based on the paper.
As their paper reported, deep learning model can significantly improve the accuracy of contacts prediction.

# Coding Challenge - Due Date, Jan 29, 2019 at 12 PM PST - Replicate AlphaFold as best you can. Post your github links in the comment section of the video! I'll give a shoutout to the top 2 entries

Wizards, see page 11 of this [paper](http://predictioncenter.org/casp13/doc/CASP13_Abstracts.pdf) and DeepMind's 
[blog post](https://deepmind.com/blog/alphafold/) for details on the AlphaFold algorithm. 2 Residual networks are used. Multiple methods are attempted. 

This code is one very related example to AlphaFold. Here are others that you can build off of

Do the best you can! I'm looking for well documented code. Good luck!
